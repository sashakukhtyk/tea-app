                    <p class="card-text">Green Chinese tea refers to a broad category of teas 
                        that are produced in China and undergo minimal oxidation during processing. 
                        The leaves are typically withered, fixed (heated to stop oxidation), rolled, 
                        and dried to preserve their green color and fresh flavor. 
                        There are numerous varieties of green Chinese tea, each with its own unique 
                        characteristics, flavors, and production methods.</p>

                        is a type of fermented tea produced primarily in the Yunnan province of China. 
                        It undergoes a unique fermentation process that involves piling, dampening, 
                        and turning the leaves over a period of weeks to months. 
                        This fermentation process creates a distinctive earthy, 
                        mellow flavor profile with hints of woodiness, reminiscent of aged wine or forest floor.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Oolong tea, also known as wulong tea, is a traditional 
                        Chinese tea that falls somewhere between green tea and black tea in terms of 
                        oxidation levels. The leaves of oolong tea are withered under the sun, oxidized, 
                        and then curled or rolled before being fired to halt oxidation. 
                        This partial oxidation process results in a wide range of flavors and aromas, 
                        depending on the specific type of oolong and how it's processed.</p>
